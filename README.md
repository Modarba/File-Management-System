File Management System
Project Overview
The File Management System is a comprehensive, scalable web application built on Laravel 11, designed to facilitate advanced management of folders and files through a hierarchical structure combined with a robust permission model. This system empowers users to efficiently create, organize, upload, download, and manipulate files and folders with fine-grained access control, supporting both individual and collaborative workflows.

Leveraging Laravel’s powerful features such as Eloquent ORM, event-driven architecture, queue system, and modular design patterns, the application ensures maintainability, performance, and extensibility. It offers a rich API-first interface, enabling seamless integration with frontend clients or third-party services.

Key Features & Functionalities
1. Folder and File Management
Full CRUD capabilities: Users can create, rename, move, and delete folders and files with ease.

Hierarchical Folder Structure: Support for infinite nesting of folders via parent-child relationships, allowing complex organization.

Path-based Querying: Efficient retrieval of folders and files based on their paths, enabling quick navigation and searches.

2. Permission System
Granular Access Control: Assign read, write, and delete permissions on specific folders per user.

Permission Inheritance: Child folders automatically inherit permissions from their parent folders, simplifying management.

API-Driven Permission Management: RESTful endpoints for granting, updating, and revoking permissions dynamically.

3. Advanced File Operations
File Upload & Storage: Securely upload files that are stored in a public disk with proper validation.

Batch Downloading: Download entire folders as ZIP archives, handled asynchronously via Laravel’s queue system to optimize performance and user experience.

ZIP Extraction: Automatically unzip uploaded ZIP files and organize their contents into corresponding folders.

4. Console Commands & Automation
Custom Artisan Commands: Tools for querying folder metrics such as child counts, sorting folders by size or creation date, and updating folder sizes to maintain accuracy.

Event Listeners & Observers: Automatically respond to changes in folders or files, e.g., recalculating folder sizes or propagating permission changes.

5. Advanced Querying & Reporting
Statistical Analysis: Identify duplicate folder names, folders within specific size ranges, and other useful metadata.

User-Folder Relations: Retrieve users based on their folder/file associations for targeted reporting or audits.

6. API-First Architecture
RESTful APIs: Comprehensive endpoints covering authentication, folder/file operations, and permission management.

Consistent Responses: Standardized HTTP responses enhanced by a custom ApiResponse trait to ensure uniformity and clarity.

7. Asynchronous Processing & Scalability
Queued Jobs: Efficient handling of resource-intensive tasks like ZIP archive creation, reducing server load and improving responsiveness.

Database Optimization: Indexed key columns (e.g., path, parent_id) to accelerate query performance and ensure smooth scalability.

Technical Stack & Architecture
Backend Framework: Laravel 11 (PHP 8.x)

Database: MySQL with optimized migrations and indexing

ORM: Eloquent ORM with advanced relationships and scopes

Queues: Laravel Queue system (Redis/Database)

API Design: RESTful services with JSON responses

Event-Driven: Observers, Events, and Listeners for real-time data consistency

Storage: Local and public disks for file uploads and downloads

Security: Role-based access controls and permission inheritance mechanisms

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
