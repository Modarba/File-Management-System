File Management System

Project Overview

The File Management System is a robust Laravel-based web application designed to manage folders and files with a focus on hierarchical organization, permissions, and efficient file operations. This system allows users to create, upload, download, and manage files and folders while enforcing access control through a granular permission model. It supports features like folder hierarchy, file compression (zip/unzip), and advanced querying capabilities, making it suitable for both personal and collaborative file management.

Built with Laravel 11, the project leverages Eloquent ORM for database interactions, Laravel's queue system for asynchronous tasks, and a modular architecture for maintainability. The system includes console commands, API endpoints, and event-driven logic to ensure scalability and flexibility.

Features





Folder and File Management:





Create, update, and delete folders and files.



Support for hierarchical folder structures with parent-child relationships.



Path-based querying for efficient folder retrieval.



Permission System:





Granular permissions (read, write, delete) for users on specific folders.



Inheritance of permissions from parent folders to child folders.



API endpoints to grant, update, or revoke permissions.



File Operations:





Upload files with automatic storage in a public disk.



Download folders as ZIP archives using queued jobs for performance.



Unzip uploaded ZIP files and organize extracted content.



Console Commands:





Custom Artisan commands to query folder child counts, order folders by various criteria (size, creation date, etc.), and update folder sizes.



Querying and Reporting:





Advanced querying for folder and file statistics (e.g., duplicate folder names, size ranges).



Retrieve users with or without associated folders/files.



Event-Driven Architecture:





Observers to automatically update folder sizes when folders/files are created, updated, or deleted.



Events and listeners for inheriting folder permissions.



API-First Design:





RESTful API endpoints for user authentication, folder/file operations, and permission management.



Standardized HTTP responses with custom status codes using the ApiResponse trait.



Asynchronous Processing:





Queued jobs for generating ZIP archives to handle large folder downloads efficiently.



Database Optimization:





Indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., path, parent_id) for performance.



Efficient migrations for folder, permission, and job tables.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
