# File Management System

## Project Overview

The **File Management System** is a robust, scalable Laravel 11 web application designed for advanced management of folders and files with a hierarchical structure and a granular permission system. It enables users to create, organize, upload, download, and manage files and folders efficiently, with fine-grained access control supporting both individual and collaborative use cases.

The system leverages Laravelâ€™s Eloquent ORM, event-driven architecture, queued jobs, and modular design to ensure maintainability, extensibility, and performance. It exposes a RESTful API for integration with frontend clients or other services.

## Features & Functionalities

### Folder and File Management

- Create, update, rename, move, and delete folders and files.
- Support for nested folder structures using self-referencing relationships (`parent_id`).
- Path-based querying for efficient retrieval of folder hierarchies.
- Hierarchical data modeled with recursive relationships enabling parent-child folder trees.

### Permission System

- Fine-grained permissions: read, write, and delete on folders for specific users.
- Permission inheritance from parent folders to child folders to simplify management.
- API endpoints to grant, update, or revoke permissions dynamically.
- Permissions stored in dedicated tables with indices for performance.

### File Operations

- Upload files to a configured public disk with automatic storage management.
- Batch download folders as ZIP archives using Laravel queued jobs to handle heavy workloads asynchronously.
- Support for unzipping uploaded archives, automatically organizing extracted files within the folder structure.
- Filesystem storage abstraction enables flexibility to switch between local, S3, or other disks.

### Artisan Console Commands

- Custom commands to:
  - Retrieve child counts for folders.
  - Order folders based on various criteria: size, creation date, etc.
  - Update folder size metadata to reflect file additions/deletions.
- These commands facilitate maintenance and reporting.

### Advanced Querying & Reporting

- Queries for detecting duplicate folder names within a scope.
- Size range queries to filter folders/files by their disk usage.
- Retrieving users with or without associated files/folders.
- Database indexes on frequently queried columns (`path`, `parent_id`, etc.) enhance performance.

### Event-Driven Architecture

- Observers automatically update folder size and metadata when files or folders are created, updated, or deleted.
- Events and listeners handle permission inheritance and cascading updates.
- This architecture decouples business logic and ensures data integrity.

### API-First Design

- RESTful API endpoints for:
  - User authentication and authorization.
  - Folder and file CRUD operations.
  - Permission management (granting, updating, revoking).
- JSON responses standardized using a custom `ApiResponse` trait.
- API routes grouped and versioned for scalability.

### Asynchronous Processing

- Use of Laravel queues (database, Redis, or other drivers) for processing heavy tasks like ZIP generation.
- Improves user experience by offloading time-consuming tasks.

### Database & Performance Optimization

- Migrations define tables for folders, files, permissions, and jobs.
- Indexes added on critical columns such as `path`, `parent_id`, and permission keys.
- Foreign keys enforce referential integrity.
- Efficient schema design supports hierarchical queries and fast lookups.

## Technical Details

### Data Models

- **Folder**: has `id`, `name`, `parent_id`, `path`, `size`, timestamps.
  - Self-referential `parent_id` forms a tree structure.
  - `path` column stores full folder path for fast querying.
- **File**: belongs to a folder, stores file metadata (name, size, MIME type, path).
- **Permission**: links users to folders with permission types (read, write, delete).
- **User**: standard Laravel user model with relationships to permissions.

### Relationships

- Folder has many children (folders).
- Folder has many files.
- User has many permissions on folders.

### Folder Size Updates

- Observers listen to file/folder changes.
- Folder size is recalculated recursively to include all child folders and files.
- Size updates triggered on create, update, delete events.

### Queued ZIP Generation

- On folder download request, a queued job creates a ZIP archive of the folder contents.
- The job runs asynchronously to prevent blocking HTTP responses.
- Users can download the ZIP once ready.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
