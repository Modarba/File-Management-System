# File Management System

## Project Overview

The **File Management System** is a comprehensive, scalable web application built on **Laravel 11**, designed to facilitate advanced management of folders and files through a hierarchical structure combined with a robust permission model. This system empowers users to efficiently create, organize, upload, download, and manipulate files and folders with fine-grained access control, supporting both individual and collaborative workflows.

Leveraging Laravelâ€™s powerful features such as Eloquent ORM, event-driven architecture, queue system, and modular design patterns, the application ensures maintainability, performance, and extensibility. It offers a rich API-first interface, enabling seamless integration with frontend clients or third-party services.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
